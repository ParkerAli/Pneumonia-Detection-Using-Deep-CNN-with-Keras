Reader can open either the PneumoniaDetectionCNN html file or the Jupyter Notebook. The displays are identical. My complete set of model structures and 
weights have been omitted because of github's file size limits. Instead, just the one I will refer to and the one that the project notebook will create 
are already in the repository. The google colab notebook does provide the necessary code to achieve similar weights if needed.
